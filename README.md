# zombie_accounts_detection
Zombie account (churned) reactivation -- The development phase continues locally and will be uploaded when completed.

Problem Statement

Many online services experience user churn, leaving behind "zombie accounts"â€”inactive user profiles with occasional, small transactions. This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies zombie accounts and suggests the most effective re-engagement strategies.

Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preparation
    a. Synthetic Data Generation: I'll Employ the Synthetic Data Vault (SDV) library to generate realistic synthetic transaction data based on the structure and correlations within the existing dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation/data) The dataset captures user transactions, timestamps, account registration dates, and profile/demographic information (if available).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Defining  "Zombie Accounts"
4. Modeling
   Baseline: Starting with simple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to establish a performance benchmark.
   Advanced Models: Investigating the combining LSTM outputs with features derived from traditional machine learning models for potential performance gains.
